	Abstract. String theory in physics and molecular biology use p-adic
	
	
	numbers as a tool to describe properties of microworld in a more adequate
	
	
	way. We consider a notion of automata and Turing machines using p-adic
	
	
	numbers to describe random branching of the process of computation.
	We
	
	
	prove that Turing machines of this type can have advantages in reversal
	
	
	complexity over deterministic and probabilistic Turing machines.
	
	
	
	1 Introduction
	
	
	
	Pascal and Fermat believed that every event of indeterminism can be
	described
	
	
	by a real number between 0 and 1 called probability. Quantum physics
	introduced
	
	
	a description in terms of complex numbers called amplitude of probabilities
	and
	
	
	later in terms of probabilistic combinations of amplitudes most conveniently
	
	
	described by density matrices.
	
	
	
	String theory [10], chemistry [8] and molecular biology [3, 6] have
	introduced
	
	
	p-adic numbers to describe measures of indeterminism.
	
	
	
	There were no difficulties to implement probabilistic automata and
	algo-
	
	
	rithms practically. Quantum computation [5] has made a considerable
	theo-
	
	
	retical progress but practical implementation has met considerable
	difficulties.
	
	
	However, prototypes of quantum computers exist, some quantum algorithms
	are
	
	
	implemented on these prototypes, quantum cryptography is already practically
	
	
	used. Some people are skeptical concerning practicality of the initial
	spectac-
	
	
	ular promises of quantum computation but nobody can deny the existence
	of
	
	
	quantum computation.
	
	
	
	We consider a new type of indeterministic algorithms called ultrametric
	algo-
	
	
	rithms. They are very similar to probabilistic algorithms but while
	probabilistic
	
	
	algorithms use real numbers r with 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 as parameters, ultrametric
	algo-
	
	
	rithms use p-adic numbers as the parameters. Slightly simplifying
	the description
	
	
	of the definitions one can say that ultrametric algorithms are the
	same proba-
	
	
	bilistic algorithms, only the interpretation of the probabilities
	is different.

	Council of

	the Eu-
	
	
	ropean Social Fund.}
